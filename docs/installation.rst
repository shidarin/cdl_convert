Installation

Pip Install
===========

Using pip is the preferred method of installation, as it installs cdl_convert
both as a python module and a script.
::
    $ pip install cdl_convert --process-dependency-links

Script Only Installation
========================

If you don't want to bother with a pip style install, you can alternatively
grab the entire `cdl_convert`_ directory, then set up a shortcut to call
``cdl_convert/cdl_convert.py``

Creating aliases, etc are beyond the scope of this documentation.

Note you will need to install `OpenTimelineIO`_ to parse EDLs.
